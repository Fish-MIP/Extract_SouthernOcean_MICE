# Extracting data for the Southern Ocean MICE model
The Python script available here was developed to extract data from Earth System Models available in the DKRZ server. The masks used to extract data for this regions are available in the compressed (`7z`) folder.  

Note that sub-regions of the Southern Ocean have a unique ID identifying them in the masks. The name of each sub-region together with their ID are included in the csv file contained in the masks folder.
